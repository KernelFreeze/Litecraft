[Open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), [clean room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design) implementation of [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) Client. Currently work in progress, you should expect it not to work as desired.

# ðŸŽ‰ F.A.Q

## ðŸ¤” How long will it take you to program a usable version?
Although we have thousands of hours of work, we probably have many thousands more.

## ðŸ˜  It doesn't compile!
Double check that you have the latest nightly Rust! We use experimental features, which allow us create awesome features!
