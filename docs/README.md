[Open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), [clean room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design) implementation of [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) Client. Currently work in progress, you should expect it not to work as desired.

# 💠 Features and differences with vanilla:
- [X] Litecraft doesn't require or use Java.
- [X] Native performance and great memory management.
- [X] Faster and better rendering system.
- [X] Multi-threaded.

# 🎉 F.A.Q

## 🤔 How long will it take you to program a usable version?
Although we have thousands of hours of work, we probably have many thousands more.

## 😠 It doesn't compile!
Double check that you have the latest nightly Rust! We use experimental features, which allow us create awesome features!
